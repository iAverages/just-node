# just-node

Our machines did not have node installed so this repository contains node v18 bin and a script to setup the terminal to
work correctly.

## Setup

To get Node working on the machine you need to open cmd to the folder containing this repository and type `setup.bat`.
This will run a few commands to setup node, npm and npx and allow them to work hopefully without issues.

> Node will only work in that terminal session, if you close cmd at all you will need to re-run the script.
